  Beneath the cloak of predawn's embrace, a figure moves with the quiet promise of youth, skirting the edges of Eldoria's grandeur. \
  The city, a tapestry of towering aspirations and hushed marketplaces, slumbers under a shroud of uneasy silence, its heartbeats muffled by whispers of shadows yet unseen.
tutorial.welcome.character-introduction=\
  This is your story, etched in the fervor of dreams too vast for the confines of cobblestone realities. \
  Armed with naught but the raw edge of daring and a spark of cunning, you stand at the precipice of fate, drawn inexorably to the one haven where chaos births legends: the veiled sanctum of the Thieves' Guild of Eldoria.
tutorial.welcome.guild-introduction=\
  Yet, the Guild's embrace is not for the faint of heart, for its thresholds are guarded by riddles and trials, known only to those whose courage outshines the glint of steel in the moonlight. \
  A trial awaits in the arena, an ancient dance of destiny where the threads of future are woven or severed.
tutorial.welcome.arena-entrance=\
  With dawn's first whisper, the city's ancient bones are cast in a tapestry of shadows, and it is here you find yourself, before a gateway shrouded in secrecy, its whispers laden with promise and peril alike. \
  Your heart, a drum of war and wonder, echoes the tumultuous cadence of the coming storm. \
  "Step forth, child of the shadows," intones a voice, as ethereal as the morning mist, "for the fate of Eldoria is a tapestry in flux, and you seek to claim your thread amongst its hues. \
  Prove your mettle, let the Guild be your crucible, your sanctuary, your kin. Falter, and fade into the annals of the forgotten, another wraith in the city's endless lament." \
  Drawing a breath that tastes of destiny, you cross the threshold, the gates behind you whispering tales of those who walked this path before. \
  Herein lies your odyssey, in the heart of Eldoria, where shadows sing secrets and every choice forges the path of your legacy.

  "What name shall the echoes of these halls whisper, young aspirant?" the shadows inquire, a prelude to the saga awaiting your breath.

  So be it, {0}. The crucible of your tale ignites this very moment. May your wit be as swift as the wind, your resolve as steadfast as the deep roots of Eldoria. \
  With the resolve of a thousand whispered vows, you step forth into the arena, its gates sealing with the finality of fate's own decree...
tutorial.arena.introduction=\
  The arena stretches before you, an expanse of dust and echoes, bound by ancient stone and the weight of countless stories. \
  Torches flicker in their sconces, casting a wavering glow upon the figures gathered within, each a potential ally or adversary in the crucible that awaits. \
  You must prove your worth to the Guild by facing these encounters. Each figure you meet can become a valuable ally, or a fierce opponent. \
  The more allies you gather, the easier your journey will be after this trial. However, you may choose to walk this path alone, should you seek the challenge.

  The first figure steps forward, a warrior of sinew and scars, eyes like embers smoldering in the twilight. \
  "I am Thane. Will you join me, or must I test your mettle?" his voice is a growl, a promise of strength either shared or opposed.

  Next, a shadow detaches itself from the periphery, coalescing into a lithe, hooded form. \
  "Call me Nyssa," she whispers, a dagger spinning lazily in her fingers. "The shadows are my domain. Together, we could dance through danger unseen. What say you?"

  From a darkened archway, a figure clad in robes steps forth, eyes glinting with arcane knowledge. \
  "I am Elyndor. Ally with me, and the very elements shall bow to our will. Or shall I test your resistance to the unknown?"
tutorial.arena.encounter-3=\
  A giant of a man, with a heartwarming smile incongruous to his size, approaches next. \
  "They call me Brom," he rumbles. "With my strength at your side, we could move mountains. But cross me, and you will find that even the kindest of giants can be a fearsome foe."
tutorial.arena.encounter-4=\
  Finally, a woman with an ethereal grace steps into view, her presence both calming and commanding. \
  "I am Selene. Let me join you, and your path shall be enlightened by my presence. Or must I let the shadows claim you?"
